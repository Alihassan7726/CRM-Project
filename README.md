### Project Title: Improving the sales for X-Axis Solutions

Increasing the sales of X-Axis Solutions has been one of the challenging
issue. So, based on client requirements we provided a deep learning based
solution in order to increase their sales.

We captured the data from clientâ€™s CRM to look into sales patterns & 
generated sales flow chart to get better view about the sales process. We 
planned to deliver weather a person is going to buy their product or not.
If there is more probability for a customer to buy the product we can then 
try best sales tricks what this person like based on similar customer records.

We solved this problem using BERT algorithm.
